# üå∏ Flower102 Image Classification (EfficientNetB2 + Hugging Face Deployment)

This project demonstrates how to classify flower images from the [Oxford Flower102 dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) using a pretrained **EfficientNetB2** model with **PyTorch**, and deploy the trained model to **Hugging Face Spaces**.

The entire workflow‚Äîfrom data processing and model training to evaluation and deployment‚Äîis available in two Google Colab notebooks in this repository.

## üìÅ Project Setup

Since this project is based on **Google Colab**, there is **no fixed folder structure** in the repository. However, running the notebook will dynamically generate the required directories such as:

```
/data/
    /flowers102/
    /3_types_of_flowers_10%/
    /3_types_of_flowers_20%/
    /3_types_of_flowers_100%/

models/
    pretrained_effnetb2_feature_extractor_3_types_of_flowers_100%.pth
```

## üöÄ Quick Start
1. Open the Colab notebook from this repo:
2. Run all cells sequentially. The notebook will:
    - Download and prepare the dataset
    - Train the model
    - Save the model
    - Predict on test images
    - Export the model for deployment
3. Deploy to Hugging Face using the exported model and interface code.
